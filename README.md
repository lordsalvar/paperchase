## How Envoyr Works?

1. QR Code Generation:
The originating office generates a unique QR code and attaches it to the document. This code serves as the primary means of tracking the document's journey.

2. Assigning a Destination Office:
The system or sender assigns the intended receiving office where the document should be delivered.

3. QR Code Scanning:
Upon receipt, the receiving office scans the document’s QR code. This action logs the location and confirms the document’s arrival at the designated office.

4. System Notification:
The system sends a real-time notification to registered users, indicating where and when the document was last scanned.

5. Receiving Office Decision:
The receiving office evaluates the document and decides:

    To return it via official delivery, or

    To hold it for pickup by the originating office or another party.

6. Final Document Receipt:
The document completes its journey when it is successfully returned or picked up by the original creator or authorized recipient.
